Customer churn analysis - Telco. 
EDA and Random Forest Analysis
Electronic check, fibre optic and month-to-month contracts show a strong correlation.
Discounts, installation fees and other charges or the lack of it affect churn.
Month-to-month contracts and short tenures do correlate with churn.
The random forest model shows a low recall and needs improvement, maybe through more feature engineering.
